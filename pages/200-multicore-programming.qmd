title:  Multicore (local) Parallel Programming
---

You have now learned how to use functional programming to write your Python script as a set of functions that can be mapped against or used to reduce lists of data. In the next parts of the course you will learn how to use functional programming to parallelise a Python script. In this part, you will learn how to parallelise a script over the cores of a single computer, while in the next part you will see how to parallelise a script across a cluster of computer nodes.
